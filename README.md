###  AWS S3 Acl Permissions

***Issue:*** 
* Errors related to AWS S3 acl (access control list) permissions not being enabled

***Solution:*** 
* Google exact error message
* Look for instructions on how to enable acl permissions
* There should be a checkbox in the browser interface for your AWS S3 bucket

---
### WSL Unexpectedly Devouring Memory (Windows users)

***Issue:*** 
There have been a number of incidence where students encounter an issue where WSL for some reason begins devouring memory without bound, causing systems to slow to a hault and become unusable.
If you are experience extreme system slowdowns and breakage when starting your VSCode or WSL, have a look at your task manager.

![task_manager_ex](https://i.ibb.co/Sndpy2z/wsldeath.png)

Notice the insane memory usage of process vmmem, if you are seeing this, this most likely means that WSL is being allocated too much virtual memory; so while this much memory is not actually being dedicated to any real process, it is marked as being consumed as far as the Windows kernel is concerned. 

***Solution:*** 
To fix this, you will first want to note the amount of memory your system has. After you have done this, create a .wslconfig file in your home user directory, i.e. C:\\User\\[YOUR_USERNAME]. Inside of that file, include the following

```
[wsl2]
memory=<MAX_MEMORY>
```
Where <MAX_MEMORY> is approximately 1/4 the total memory of your system in G. For instance, if you had 8 GB RAM, your .wslconfig should something look like
```
[wsl2]
memory=2GB
```
Restart your machine and observe your memory usage. Run free -g in your WSL shell, if allocated memory matches your config, it works.

***NOTES:***
- You can easily access user profile directory by entering %USERPROFILE% in file manager.
- If config is not loading, first verify that .wslconfig DOES NOT have .txt extension. To verify it does not, make sure you do not have hidden file extensions option enabled in your file manager. (Views > Options)

### Mix Content Error

***Issue:***
"Mixed content occurs when initial HTML is loaded over a secure HTTPS connection, but other resources (such as images, videos, stylesheets, scripts) are loaded over an insecure HTTP connection."

![image (4)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76798385/159103068-49f56ab8-e350-42b7-8c92-6a7c075e8732.png)

If you encounter this error, you most likely have a trailing slash in the fetch request or in the backend API route. Make sure the resource (URL) you pass in the global fetch() method on the frontend exactly matches the API route in the backend. If the resources (URLs) are not exactly matched, you may encounter a mix content error on Heroku. 

***Good Example***: The resource in the Fetch Method ***"/api/users/1/"*** has to exactly match the backend API route ***"/api/users/1/"***


***Bad Example***: The resource in the Fetch Method ***"/api/users/1"*** does NOT match the backend API route ***"/api/users/1/"***

***NOTES:***
For more details about mix content errors, visit https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content/How_to_fix_website_with_mixed_content

You can also add ```<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="upgrade-insecure-requests">``` in the header tag and this will "upgrade" any resources that is loaded over HTTP to HTTPS. More information visit https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/upgrade-insecure-requests.

------
### Heroku: Assets Retrieved From Backend API Calls Not Rendering
Make sure that a trailing backslash is appended to paths in fetches within *action thunks* or straight *fetch calls*; i.e.
```
fetch('/api/images/');
```
and NOT
```
fetch('/api/images');
```

---
### Heroku: 500 level errors on login / signup
* triple-check environment variables and PostgreSQL installation on Heroku specifically
* make sure to actually add environment variables on Heroku, they have to be saved

---
### npm ERR! code ENOSPC
This means there is no space left on user's device. Appears to be insufficient space on your system to finish. 
You have to clear up some disc space (try deleting unused docker container, images) and then try running the command again. 

```
docker system prune
```
This will remove all unused containers, networks, images to help free up space.

### GitHub Secrets aka Environment Variables for GitHub Actions
- Q: How do I reference sensitive environment variables I would typically store in a local .env file when I do not expose that file to git version control?
- A: GitHub Secrets: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets

---
### Using Object.values 
- Q:  I have the query result ordered by ratings of the jokes in descending order from the backend. However, on the frontend the query is still rendering the result in order of the id (back to ascending order). 
- A: When dealing with an Array-like object with random key ordering, notice how the array is rearranged in acending order based on the numberic key. When using numeric keys, **the values are returned in the keys' numerical order**. 
```
const arrayLikeObj2 = { 100: 'a', 2: 'b', 7: 'c' };
console.log(Object.values(arrayLikeObj2 )); // ['b', 'c', 'a']
```
- Visit https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/values for more information.

---
### Proper use of Google Maps API
Google Maps API comes in an embeddable form which references an old version with deprecated methods: this is intended for use in static pages which only reference the API via iframes, as it allows the user to interface with the API without using Javascript. Google provides a developer targeted API and an associated npm package for interfacing with it. The documentation for this is here:
- https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview#maps_map_simple-javascript

### User is Logged out/Session disappears on Refresh
üóÉ **Tags:** *[Auth] [Unauthorized] [Log out]*

***Issue:***
The session user disappears on refresh, essentially logging out a user. From the auth thunk in session.js, console.logging the error  gives "Unauthorized". The api route /api/auth is not being hit. 

***Solution:*** 
The functions that handle the auth are all working in the starter. This occurs when the trailing "/" is removed from `authenticate` function in session.js. It must be there to hit the route. 
```
const response = await fetch('/api/auth/', { ...
```
---
### Minor CSS overlapping issue
üóÉ **Tags:** *[CSS] [Overlap] [Meta]*

***Issue:***
The styling and formatting of divs only works on very large screens for various reasons.

***Solution:***
(Quick fix) Put this meta tag within the `<head>` HTML tag. 
Adjust the initial-scale value to what works best; this is essentially zooming out the users screen automatically.
```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=0.5">
```
---
### Required Attribute Not Working!
üóÉ **Tags:** *[Form] [Input] [Required] [Validation]*

***Issue:***
The requried attribute isn't stopping a form from submitting a blank input.

***Solution***
A few reasons why this could be happening, here are a few things to check:
1. Input tag must be inside a form tag.
2. Form needs to have a `type=submit` button/div/input. 
3. The input tag's event attribute must be `onSubmit=...`
